The analysis provided the overall summary across the district and the schools. The analysis showed variations in the percentage of students passing math and reading exams, some schools has highest overall passing rates while the others struggled to meet the passing criteria. The analysis highlighted disparities in student performance across schools, indicating the need for further investigation into factors influencing academic outcomes.

•	Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations

	There are significant disparities in math and reading performance among schools in the district. Analyzing the average scores for each school and comparing them with the total student size is a crucial step in understanding the performance trends. It seems that schools with smaller or medium-sized student populations tend to perform better than those with larger group sizes. This observation could lead to further investigations into factors that may contribute to this trend, such as teacher-to-student ratios, resources available per student, or even the school's teaching methods. 
	Students performance was analyzed at the grade level and also based on the specific subjects math and the reading is essential for understanding their academic strengths and areas that may need improvement. Need more information on the per student spending. Analyzing per student spending alongside student performance can provide valuable insights for educators to make informed decisions.
